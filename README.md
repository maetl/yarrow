Yarrow

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/maetl/yarrow.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/maetl/yarrow) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/maetl/yarrow/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/maetl/yarrow) [![Test Coverage](https://codeclimate.com/github/maetl/yarrow/badges/coverage.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/maetl/yarrow)

Yarrow is a tool for generating well structured documentation from a variety of input sources.

Unlike most static site generators and code documentation tools, Yarrow is written with design and content-strategy in mind. It does not impose its own structure on your content. This makes it appropriate for building static sites and blogs as well as style guides and API docs.

Install
-------

Get it from RubyGems:

```
gem install yarrow
```

Alternatively, you can reference it from a `Gemfile` and run `bundle install`:

```
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "yarrow"
```

Usage Instructions
------------------

Yarrow is an extraction from several existing private projects. This repo is in pre-alpha state, which means that most of the useful features are not yet folded into this codebase.
