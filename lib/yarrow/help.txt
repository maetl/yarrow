Arguments

<source_dir> - Path to source directory or an individual source file. If not
               supplied defaults to the current working directory. Multiple
               directories can be specified by repeating arguments, separated
               by whitespace.

<output_dir> - Path to the generated documentation. If not supplied, defaults
               to `./docs` in the current working directory. If it does not
               exist, it is created. If it does exist it remains in place, but
               existing files are overwritten by new files with the same name.

Options

Use -o or --option for boolean switches and --option=value or --option:value
for options that require an explicit value to be set.

  -h    --help        [switch]    Display this help message and exit
  -v    --version     [switch]    Display version header and exit
  -c    --config      [string]    Path to a config properties file
  -p    --packages    [string]    Defines package convention for the model
  -t    --theme       [string]    Template theme for generated docs

Not all these options currently work as they date back to when this library
was used for generating documentation for PHP codebases, before it was
generalised into a static site generator.
